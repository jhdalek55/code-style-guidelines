# Code Style Guidelines

This repo lists code style guidelines and programming recommendations for
software written at the [Secure Systems Lab](https://ssl.engineering.nyu.edu/)
of the NYU Tandon School of Engineering.

The primary purpose of our software is to provide reference implementations
for the specifications we design. As such **readability** is a key
requirement.

Moreover, we believe that readability has a strong positive impact on the
security, correctness, and robustness of the code, and thus on the overall
quality of our software, which is especially important for those of our
projects that are used in production.

And last but not least, readable code allows contributors of all different
backgrounds and skill levels to engage in our projects, which in turn helps to
create a lively and diverse open source community.
